       <h2>My dream : Youpitwo</h2>
       
       <p>
            As you may have already discovered, I learned to sail on a dinghy "l'Equipe". Marc Laurent designed the little brother of the "Flying Dutchman" in 1982. I found this boat of 4 meters long in a sailing club in 2013 and and that year, the 34th America's Cup took place. It was the first sailing competition on foiling boats, the AC72, in front of the striking image of this flying catamaran, the dream was born.

       <h2>Echange Afrique INSA</h2>
       
       <p>
           When I chose to go to INSA Rennes, I didn't know how it would change my life and bring me incredible experiences. This project is obviously the best example!
       </p>
       <br>
       
       <img src="Images/partyEAI.jpg" alt="Party EAI" align="right" class="partyEAI">
       
       <p>
           In September 2023, I met eleven other students with whom I will work in the student association "Échange Afrique INSA". We were divided into 5 teams: I was in charge of communication and travel. I managed the social media, the website and I wrote emails to promote the project. It was the building of a nursery school in Côte d'Ivoire, in Konan'N Drikro.
To finance this project, we sold crêpes & galettes at each party, organized a sale of sockets, and created a fund. To complete the budget of 25,000€, we claimed grants from the INSA Group, the city of Rennes, Brittany, Europe, and companies.

       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
          We left for Côte d'Ivoire in June, but the planning of the trip was a lot of work: we had to book the plane tickets for the team, get the visas, organize the vaccinations, and we planned a one-week road trip before staying three weeks in the village.
It was a true cultural exchange during the stay: we learned to cook, harvest, dance, and live in the rhythm of the village. We participated in painting the school: we painted the outdoors and decorated it with drawings and frescoes.
       </p>

                Sailing experience
            </h1>
        <h2>A beginning in single-handed sailing</h2>

       <p>
            I started sailing with my father on an Optimist in 2008 when I was 8 years old. I continued my training on an L'Equipe dinghy and I started competing in Optimist and later in Open Bic. I made great progress in Open Bic in different clubs of Brittanny and I competed at regional, national, and European levels until participated in the french and world championship in 2018. 
       </p>
       <h2>Crewed sailing</h2>
       <p>
       After 3 years in Open Bic, I created a crew with 2 friends to race in the Open 5.70. I discovered the sailing with a crew on this sportboat and we took part in very famous competition like the Spi Ouest-France and the GPEN and another French Championship. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This French Championship in 2019 marked the beginning of my time at highschool in Lorient where I enrolled in the Sailing option. We sailed on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays and on Thursdays we had fitness training. I started sailing catamaran in Hobie Cat 16 and then in the Nacra 15 and during the winter we sailed in J80. We participated my fourth French Championship, but the COVID-19 marked the end of our crew.
        </p>
        <h2>Discovering the foil</h2>
        <p>
        It marked a turning point in my sailing career because I decided to obtain the diploma to become a sailing trainer. I work for three years and I kept racing when I had opportunities on RSAero, Open 5.70, J70 or J80. And this summer I started a new sport: the Wingfoil!
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently I take part in the crew of the ENSTA Sailing Team. It's the sailing association of my Engineering school. We train every Thursday afternoon and we compete in events like the University French Championship and lately we won the Harbour Island Trophy, a qualification for the french championship.

        <h2>Designer in Computed Wing Sail</h2>

       <p>
        At the moment, I am doing an apprenticeship in Naval Architecture at Computed Wing Sail. Never heard of this company ? We are building the most efficient wing sail for a cargo ship! Our concept is based on an asymmetric airfoil with a folding system. While sailing, the wing measures 350m² and 36m high and it can be reduced to 18m when folded in port. I work in the R&D department as a designer, and since October 2024 I have been working on three subjects: 
       </p>
        <ol>
            <li>I prepare salt spray experiments to compare different protections against the corrosion. I drew on my course in oxidation-reduction in chemistry to better understand the corrosion and I researched to find protection like metallization, coating with a C5H protection level, flake zinc, grease and polymeric protection.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>I conducted a preliminary study to replace the entire inversion system with winches and I highlighted interesting results and advantages but this solution requires many modifications for the first model and we decided to keep this idea for the second version of our wing.</li>
            <br>
            
            <li>I am developing a system to lock the wing at the end of the folding process. It's an interesting subject that allows me to really enter in the job of the designer by writing specification, make a predesign with different concepts of locking, presenting them to my superiors for trade-off decisions and compute finite element simulations to optimize the product. The mains challenges of this subject are the space taken by the products, the weight and the maintenance and ensuring waterproofing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Internship in a Research laboratory</h2>
        
        <img src="Images/internshipIRDL.png" alt="Internship IRDL" align="right" class="internshipIRDL">
        
        <p>This is not my first professional experience, in my first year at INSA I completed an internship at the Dupuy-De-Lôme research laboratory in Lorient. They specialize in new materials, and I worked on the Flower Project, which focuses on developing flax fibers to build car roofs, sales displays, or boat parts, as a replacement for glass fiber. The goal is to reduce the carbon footprint by using locally harvested flax near the production area. However, they discovered that flax fibers absorb too much water. During my 4-week internship, I tested and compared different solutions to reduce water absorption. I built composite samples in PLA and PP by milling, and then performed tensile, bending, and water absorption tests. I also observed the effect of treatments on the fibers using SEM imaging.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Trainer in a sailing club</h2>

        <img src="Images/optimistTraining.JPG" alt="Optimist Training" align="left" class="optimistTraining">
        <p>
            My longest professional experience has been my job as a sailing trainer, from September 2021 to July 2024. I worked at the Lorient Sailing Club, training children aged 6 to 10 on Optimist boats every Saturday. I brought them to their first competitions on Sundays, and by the end of the year, we participated in regional and national events over several days. This job required me to stay calm under pressure in difficult weather conditions, especially when it was windy and cold and the children were tired. I had to keep them motivated, and my goal was to make sure they didn’t give up! During training, I had to be creative in designing new exercises to stimulate their passion for sailing and adapt the sessions to each child's specific difficulties
            <br>
            <br>
            This job was quite challenging because it took place during a demanding period of my studies, my first two years of engineering school, so I had to carefully organize my classes and revisions.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            What’s next?
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            As you can see, I’ve had various professional experiences, sometimes complementary, and it’s not over yet! My next goal is to pursue a PhD in meteorology.
        <br>
            This is another essential aspect of sailing, along with naval architecture: you can't sail or win a race without studying meteorology. That’s why, during my sailing training, I had courses to understand different meteorological systems, both on a large and small scale. It was always courses very interesting and I dreamed to really understand the meteorology and the types of clouds and their meanings. When I became a sailing trainer, I taught this field of science with a great pleasure. 
        <br>
        <br>
            And the PhD? It’s for me the way the most interesting to discover this field because it will bring me a valuable experience in both theorical and research.
        <br>
            But before starting a PhD, I have several steps to take in order to improve my knowledge of meteorology, and I would like to begin with an internship in a research project in this field.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="italic">Rennes, INSA from 2022 to 2024</span>
            <br>
            INSA Rennes is a great French Engineering school part of the INSA Group founded in 1957 and with 7 schools in France. The INSA Group is very attractive on the international level, and I had the chance to share my studies with Vietnamese, Turkish, Chinese, Lebanese, Greek, Tunisian, Nigerian, Chadian in an international class.
            <br>
            The program lasts five years: the two first years were dedicated to taking courses in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry to understand the concepts that surround us.  
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>In mathematics I had courses on linear algebra with the vector spaces, matrices and matrix reduction and using linear algebra to solve differential equations. In analysis we worked on approximating functions with the Taylor series, calculating limits, multiple integrals, the Riemann integral, improper integral and series. I learnt to optimise a problem using Lagrange multipliers. In probability I started with the basics like probability distributions and conditional probability before exploring the continuous random variables.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of physics courses: in electricity, electromagnetism, electronics, waves, geometrical optics and thermal energy. In each course there were practical sessions to explore the different concepts. And finally, I studied chemistry on atomic structure, crystallography, thermodynamics and polymers. </li>
            <li>Coding is a fundamental step to become an engineer. I learnt the basics until the object-oriented programming in Java and to interact with a database in SQL and create an interface using Java. I worked on a project for a research laboratory I developed an application using MATLAB to calculate the thickness of metal alloys in Matlab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After two very intensive years, I had the opportunity to choose a department to specialize in. However, the one I chose was quite different from the others...
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="italic">Brest, ENSTA from 2024 to 2027</span>
            <br>
            I finally decided to leave INSA Rennes to join a program more specialized, which will help me achieve my dream to become a naval architect. So, in September 2024 I enrolled at ENSTA to start an engineering program in Naval and Offshore architecture through an apprenticeship.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A large part of the coursework is about mechanics with the rigid bodies mechanics, continuum mechanics, strength of materials and finite element method. Technical courses are necessary for a mechanical engineer to understand manufacturing process, to size the mechanical joints or hydraulic systems. I also have courses in electronics to understand and select appropriate sensors and to learn how to use microcontrollers like Arduino.</li>
            <li>Another part of the coursework is very interesting because we use coding to solve mathematics and physics problems. Using the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries I learnt to perform matrix reduction, solve differential equations using Euler or Runge-Kutta methods or calculate approximation errors for functions or integrals. </li>
        </ul>

       <h2>A dreamer</h2>
       
       <p>
       At 21 years old, I am a student in an apprenticeship company but above all, a sailing and ocean enthusiast. I started sailing before I could even walk and I learned on a small dinghy "L'Equipe" before joining competitions, and this boat is now the subject of a beautiful project <a id="discoverProject2"> that you can discover here. </a>
        <br>
        In school, maths and physics were my favourite subjects so I dreamed of becoming a Naval Architect and of studying at ENSTA. This dream came true when I was admitted to this Engineering School in September 2024 to study Naval and Offshore Architecture in apprenticeship.
        </p>
    
       <h2>International interested</h2>
       
       <p>
          Before enrolling at ENSTA, I studied for two years at INSA Rennes, another engineering school. These two years were very intensive, and I studied general courses in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science. During these two years, I was in the international class where during the practical and project courses, I was paired with a Vietnamese student.
        <br>
          The second year was more than ever turned towards the International because I joined a student association that organized an exchange with the Ivory Coast in Africa. <a id="discoverProject2"> You can learn more about this project here. </a>
        <br>
        <br>
          But that's not all: in April 2024, I went to China to participate in the Sino-Euro Spring School. During these two weeks, I attended courses about composites and composite construction. We built a model of an airplane at the end. At the NorthWestern Polytechnical University of Xi'An, and we had cultural activities to discover Chinese culture and exchange with the Chinese students.
